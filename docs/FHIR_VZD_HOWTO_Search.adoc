== Classification of the document
=== Objective
This document gives a brief overview and examples for the FHIR search API that is provided by the VZD-FHIR-Directory.

=== Target group

The document is aimed at software developers who are involved in implementing search functionality for a client of the FHIR directory service.

== API Documentation
=== FHIRDirectorySearchAPI: Search for Practitioners and Organizations
To access the search API a valid searchaccess_token is needed that can be obtained by authenticating via xref:FHIR_VZD_HOWTO_Search.adoc[Authenticate for search]

==== FHIR Search Basics
The REST interface /search allows you to search for practitioners and organizations. 
The standard FHIR search operation is used https://build.fhir.org/search.html +

GET [baseUrl]/[resourceType]?[optional parameters] +
 +
As resourceType are supported

- HealthcareService (search for organizations)
- PractitionerRole (search for practitioners)

The overview about the supported data model can be found here: 
https://simplifier.net/vzd-fhir-directory

Only resources with the status "active" may be displayed. For this reason, the [resource].active=true parameter must be specified for all search operations. The minimal variant of the search operations thus looks like this:

- GET [baseUrl]/search/HealthcareService?organization.active=true
- GET [baseUrl]/search/PractitionerRole?practitioner.active=true

As result, the client receives a FHIR http://hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html[Bundle] resource with the search result. +
 +
 +	
 
In addition to the HL7 FHIR specification, the FHIR VZD supports the following search parameters 	

- practitioner.qualification	
- location.address (e.g. to search for TI-Messenger addresses)	

The following HL7 FHIR search parameters are not yet support (but are in work):	

- https://hl7.org/fhir/search.html#_text[_text]	
- https://hl7.org/fhir/search.html#_content[_content]	

 
IMPORTANT: For all search operations a valid searchaccess_token is needed that can be achieved by following the authentication flow: link:FHIR_VZD_HOWTO_Authenticate.adoc#_authenticate_for_the_search_endpoint[Get search token]

==== FHIR Search Organizations

To search for organizations, use "HealthcareService" as the resource type and at least "organization.active=true" as the parameter:
[source]
--
GET [baseUrl]/search/HealthcareService?organization.active=true
--
Additional parameters can be added to refine the search. +
 +

==== FHIR Search Practitioners
To search for people, use "PractitionerRole" as the resource type and at least "practitioner.active=true" as the parameter:
[source]
--
GET [baseUrl]/search/PractitionerRole?practitioner.active=true
--
Additional parameters can be added to refine the search.
 +
 
==== FHIR Search Parameters - Overview
FHIR defines which search parameters can be used for each resource. 
For each resource the is a "Search Parameters" section. Examples: +

- For practitioners https://www.hl7.org/fhir/practitioner.html#search
- For organizations https://www.hl7.org/fhir/organization.html#search
- For endpoints https://www.hl7.org/fhir/endpoint.html#search
- For locations https://www.hl7.org/fhir/location.html#search

An overview about all resources with its search parameters can be found here: 
https://www.hl7.org/fhir/searchparameter-registry.html +
 +
The behavior of the search parameter depends from the parameter type and is documented here: https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#ptypes +
 +

==== FHIR Search Parameters - Custom Search Parameters
The following custom search parameters are supported in addition to the standard FHIR search parameters

- Endpoint.address
- Practitioner.qualification
** Practitioner.qualification.code.coding.code  
** Practitioner.qualification.code.coding.display


 
==== FHIR VZD Search - "practitioner.name" attribute
To search a resource the "name" attribute of it can be used in the search operation:
[source]
--
GET [baseUrl]/search/search/PractitionerRole?practitioner.active=true&practitioner.name=Timjamin
--


.Table Used search parameters
|===
|FHIR search parameter |Parameter Value | Explanation

==== FHIR VZD Search - "endpoint.payload-type" attribute (code based search)
To search a resource which supports a defined type of communication the "endpoint.payload-type" attribute can be used in the search operation:
[source]
--
