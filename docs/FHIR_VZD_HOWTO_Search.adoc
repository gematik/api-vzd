== API Documentation
=== FHIRDirectorySearchAPI: Search for Practitioners and Organizations
To access the search API a valid searchaccess_token is needed that can be obtained by authenticating via xref:FHIR_VZD_HOWTO_Search.adoc[Authenticate for search]

==== FHIR Search Basics
The REST interface /search allows you to search for practitioners and organizations. 
The standard FHIR search operation is used https://build.fhir.org/search.html +

GET [baseUrl]/[resourceType]?[optional parameters] +
 +
As resourceType are supported

- HealthcareService (search for organizations)
- PractitionerRole (search for practitioners)

The overview about the supported data model can be found here: 
https://simplifier.net/vzd-fhir-directory

Only resources with the status "active" may be displayed. For this reason, the [resource].active=true parameter must be specified for all search operations. The minimal variant of the search operations thus looks like this:

- GET [baseUrl]/search/HealthcareService?organization.active=true
- GET [baseUrl]/search/PractitionerRole?practitioner.active=true

As result, the client receives a FHIR http://hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html[Bundle] resource with the search result. +
 +
 +	
 
In addition to the HL7 FHIR specification, the FHIR VZD supports the following search parameters 	

- practitioner.qualification	
- location.address (e.g. to search for TI-Messenger addresses)	

The following HL7 FHIR search parameters are not yet support (but are in work):	

- https://hl7.org/fhir/search.html#_text[_text]	
- https://hl7.org/fhir/search.html#_content[_content]	

 
IMPORTANT: For all search operations a valid searchaccess_token is needed that can be achieved by following the authentication flow: link:FHIR_VZD_HOWTO_Authenticate.adoc#_authenticate_for_the_search_endpoint[Get search token]

==== FHIR Search Organizations

To search for organizations, use "HealthcareService" as the resource type and at least "organization.active=true" as the parameter:
[source]
--
GET [baseUrl]/search/HealthcareService?organization.active=true
--
Additional parameters can be added to refine the search. +
 +

==== FHIR Search Practitioners
To search for people, use "PractitionerRole" as the resource type and at least "practitioner.active=true" as the parameter:
[source]
--
GET [baseUrl]/search/PractitionerRole?practitioner.active=true
--
Additional parameters can be added to refine the search.
 +
 
==== FHIR Search Parameters - Overview
FHIR defines which search parameters can be used for each resource. 
For each resource the is a "Search Parameters" section. Examples: +

- For practitioners https://www.hl7.org/fhir/practitioner.html#search
- For organizations https://www.hl7.org/fhir/organization.html#search
- For endpoints https://www.hl7.org/fhir/endpoint.html#search
- For locations https://www.hl7.org/fhir/location.html#search

An overview about all resources with its search parameters can be found here: 
https://www.hl7.org/fhir/searchparameter-registry.html +
 +
The behavior of the search parameter depends from the parameter type and is documented here: https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#ptypes +
 +

==== FHIR Search Parameters - Custom Search Parameters
The following custom search parameters are supported in addition to the standard FHIR search parameters

- Endpoint.address
- Practitioner.qualification
** Practitioner.qualification.code.coding.code  
** Practitioner.qualification.code.coding.display

==== Full-text search

The aim of the full-text search is to replace the cumbersome parameter-based search with a simple full-text search. By entering a simple search string, a user should be shown suitable results without having to know the technical internals of the underlying FHIR resources. +
 +
The full-text search feature from HAPI is used and extended for the https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#_text[_text] search parameter. +

- The HAPI/FHIR full-text search supports the search for texts in the base resource. This HAPI/FHIR full-text search can be used with the https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#_content[_content] search parameter. +
- This HAPI/FHIR full-text search is extended in the following way to support also the full-text search for linked resources (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#_text[_text] search parameter).: 

. The values of the text attributes of all linked resources are stored in the _text field of HealthcareSevice for organizations and PractitionerRole for people.  
This happens when indexing the attributes of all linked resources after data changes.
. Because of this values in _text field the HAPI full-text search will also match the values of the linked resources, which are stored in the _text field of the main ressources.



===== Contents of the _text attribute for organizations

The content of the _text attribute is taken into account in the full-text search.

====== Full-text search and normal search
The full-text search can be combined with normal search parameters.

The _text attribute of the main resource is used for the full-text search. That's why the performance for full-text search is significantly better, i.e. for attributes from linked resources. +
If attributes are required in the search filter - which cannot be searched using the full-text search (see tables) - then they can be combined with a full-text search using normal FHIR search parameters. +
 +
In this example the _text full-text search parameter is used to search for the telematikID and the endpoint.status search parameter for active endpoints.
----
{{fhir_server}}/search/HealthcareService?organization.active=true&_include=HealthcareService:organization&_include=HealthcareService:endpoint&_include=HealthcareService:location&_text="1-2arvtst-ap104233","1-2arvtst-ap051582"&endpoint.status=active
----

====== Interesting facts about indexing
- Dot "." at the end of one word (e.g. Dr. or Str. ) +
When indexing, the period is removed because it is interpreted as the end of a sentence.

- Slash ( / ) (e.g. Arzt/Ärztin) +
When indexing, two words are generated by the slash (e.g. Arzt/Ärztin, two words Arzt and Ärztin but not the word incl. / as "Arzt/Ärztin"). +
Therefore, “Arzt/Ärztin” is not found in the search.

====== Characters with special meaning in the full-text search
Special characters can be used to specify search queries. For example, if you put the search query in quotation marks, only the results that exactly match the string will be shown. Additional symbols can be used to exclude or combine search terms, for example. Below are the important signs: +
 +
 
*Quotation marks ("...")* +
If the search text is put in quotation marks, only results with the exact same text will be found. +

Special characters (which otherwise have a special meaning) within the quotation marks are interpreted as normal characters. +
For example, the telematikID should always be put in quotation marks for full-text searches. It contains characters like "-". +

A full-text search with a string will match all linked resource with this string in an indexed attribute, also if the search string is a substring in an indexed attribute. + 
A search with _text=Berlin will e.g. match resources with "city": "Bernau bei Berlin" or "line": ["Berlingeröder Str. 13"]. +
A search with _text="Berlin" matches only resources with the exact string "Berlin" in the indexed attributes. +

Examples where the use of Quotation marks is necessary: +

- Search parameters with hyphens "-". For example the telematikID: +
  A telematikID looks like 1-1023410034573 +
  In the full-text search this "-" is a NOT operation. Without Quotation marks a full-text search will not match correctly such a value. Use _text="1-1023410034573" +
  An othe example is the street name, e.g. Karl-Marx-Straße +
- Search parameters with special characters. For example the dot "."

*AND operations (+ SPACE)* +
AND operations in search strings: The search strings are separated with the following characters

- "+" (Plus)   e.g. string1+string2
- " " (Space)  e.g. string1 string2

----
Examples: _text=Berlin "Organisation 1-2arvtst-ap000139"
          _text=Berlin +"Organisation 1-2arvtst-ap000139"
          _text=Berlin+"Organisation 1-2arvtst-ap000139"
----
All these searches match, if both strings are contained in the linked resources. 
In this expample "Berlin" is contained in the Location resource and 
"Organisation 1-2arvtst-ap000139" in the Organization name. +
 +

 
*OR operations (,)* +
OR operations in search strings: The search strings are separated with the following characters

- "|" (pipe)    has to be URL-encoded e.g. string1%20%7C%20string2
- "," (comma)   e.g. string1,string2

----
Examples: _text="1-2arvtst-ap104233"%20%7C%20"1-2arvtst-ap051582"
          _text="1-2arvtst-ap104233","1-2arvtst-ap051582"
----

All these searches match, if at least one of the strings is contained in the linked resources. +
 +

*NOT operations (-)* +
For the NOT operation, the string must begin with "-" hyphen, e.g. -string1

----
Example: _text=Niedersachsen -Hannover
----
Matches, if string Niedersachsen is contained in the linked resources but not Hannover. +
 +

*Fuzzy-Search (~)* +
~N after a word signifies edit distance (fuzziness), e.g. string~ +
The optional number N is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance[Levenshtein Edit Distance]. 
See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/common-options.html#fuzziness[Fuzziness] for valid values and more information.

----
Example: _text=Coppenbruegge~
----
Matches, if string Coppenbruegge or similar strings are contained in the linked resources. +
This example matches e.g.

- Coppenbrügge
- Coppenbruegge
- Coppenbrüge
