=== eRezept
Overview of the special data for the eRezept application.

==== Kind of organization/pharmacie
The kind of organization is stored in the Organization.type attribute. For pharmacies the following codes from https://simplifier.net/vzd-fhir-directory/organizationprofessionoid[OrganizationProfessionOID] are relevant:

- 1.2.276.0.76.4.54	Öffentliche Apotheke
- 1.2.276.0.76.4.55	Krankenhausapotheke

 +
The ability of the pharmacie to receive eRX Token is encoded in an attribute HealthcareService.characteristic. The codes are contained here https://simplifier.net/vzd-fhir-directory/healthcareservice-characteristic-vs[HealthCareServiceCharacteristicVS] +
 +
*Note*: 
An organization can create additional HealthcareServices itself. The HealthcareService with the pharmacie services can be recognized by the attribute "meta.tag" = "ldap".

==== opening hours
The opening times of pharmacies are stored in the HealthcareService.availableTime attribute. +
Exceptions to these opening times are described in HealthcareService.availabilityExceptions. +
 +
*Note*: An organization can create additional HealthcareServices itself. The HealthcareService with the opening hours of the pharmacy can be recognized by the attribute "meta.tag" = "ldap". +
 +
The opening times attributes in the Location resources are not used. +
